# 2017 SOA Predictive Analytics Symposium: Jupyter Notebooks
The opportunity to consolidate documentation, multiple programming languages, input, and output.

## Getting Started
For this tutorial, we recommend installing Python 3.5+ using the Anaconda distribution https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install/. 

Once anaconda is installed you can install the remaining dependencies by navigating to the directory of the notebook and running

```bash
conda install -c r r-essentials
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
